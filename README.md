# OREApp
Our project **OREApp** is an online recipe exchange application. Users canupload their favourite recipes and provide detailed ingredient lists, steps and also pictures. There may also be room for interaction, such as marking recipes as a personal favorite and leaving comments.
## Features
### Roles
 - **Free User:** Able to access the website and search for recipes. Can not upload anything and can not interact with other users.
 - **Registered User**: Able to upload and mark recipes. Can interact with other users.
 - **Admin:** Has inter-user privileges and can see, edit, delete every user, recipe or comment.

 ### Search
 An important feature is the search function. Users should have the option to view the recipes based on a **category**, **keywords** or **ingredients**. For this function to work optimally, the user (or an intelligent software component) must set the necessary tags.
